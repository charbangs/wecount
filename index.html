            <p>As a society, we are only as safe as our most vulnerable members.<br>The leading cause of poverty and suffering is a lack of personal community support, the failing of the social safety-net that keeps us all from falling between the cracks.</p>
            <p>WeCount is designed to strengthen our social safety-net by helping people connect + support each other with resources and donations within our communities.</p>
